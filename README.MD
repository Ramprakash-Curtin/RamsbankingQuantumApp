# Quantum Cryptographic Banking Web App

This project is a web-based quantum cryptography secured banking demo application built using:

- **Frontend:** React Native for Web with Expo
- **Backend:** Flask (Python 3.13.2)
- **Quantum Key Generation:** Qiskit (IBM Quantum)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Auth:** Firebase Authentications

---

## 🚀 Features

- Login / Sign-up with Firebase Authentication
- Quantum key generation on login (Qiskit)
- Secure fund transfers using quantum key validation
- Real-time transaction logging per user (via Firestore)
- User-friendly UI with responsive design

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

### 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js v20.19.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Python 3.13.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

---

## 🧮 Backend Setup (Flask + Qiskit)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask
pip install firebase-admin
pip install qiskit[visualization]
pip install qiskit-aer
```

3. Run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

> Make sure you have the `firebase_credentials.json` in the `backend` directory.

---

## 🎨 Frontend Setup (React Native Web with Expo)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npx expo install react-native-bouncy-checkbox
npm install firebase
npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
```

3. Start the Expo web server:

```bash
npm run web
```

This will launch the web version of your app in the browser.

---

## 🔐 Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Enable Email/Password Authentication
4. Download the service account key as `firebase_credentials.json` and place it in your `backend` folder
5. Add your Firebase config to `frontend/firebase.js`

---

## 🔥 Firestore Collections

- `users`: stores user profile info and balances
- `transactions`: logs all transfers
- `session_keys`: stores per-session quantum keys

---

## 🧠 Quantum Key Flow

- Upon login, a quantum key is generated by Flask using Qiskit
- The key is stored in Firestore and required for money transfers
- On logout, the key is deleted
- A new key is created on next login

## ✅ To Run Everything Together

1. Start Flask backend:
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

2. In a new terminal, start Expo frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run web
```

Your banking app will now be live on http://localhost:8081
